Assuming p in a pointer to int, explain the following code

if (p) // If p is a valid pointer (It points to an int, it points to the memory location
					just past the int, the if condiation will evaluate to
					true, otherwise false)

if (*p) // If the value of the int pointed to by p is a non-zero value (including negatives), the condition will
					evaluate to true
