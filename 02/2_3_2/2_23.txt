Given a pointer p, can you determine whether p points to a valid object? if so,
how? If not, why?

Given a pointer p, you cannot determine if it points to a valid object. When
you define a reference you bind it to an object and so it can be said that
a reference will always be bound to a valid object. No such binding occurs with
pointers, and so the memory to which the pointer points can change, it could become
an invalid object.
