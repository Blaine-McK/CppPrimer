 Which, if any, of the following assignments are invalid?
 If they are valid, explain what they do.

 int i = 0, &r1 = i; double d = 0, &r2 = d;

 a) r2 = 3.14159; - Changes the value of the object referenced by the reference (d) to 3.14159
 b) r2 = r1; - valid assigns the value of object i to d, does a type conversion
 c) i = r2; - valid assigns the value of object d to i, does a type conversion (Truncates the data after the decimal)
 d) r1 = d; - valid assigns the value of object i to d, does a type conversion (Truncates the data after the decimal)

 I actually didn't expect most of these to compile, I thought the compiler would complain
 about losing data going from a double to an integer - It doesn't though, the data is just truncated and
 nothing is said. Worth noting.
