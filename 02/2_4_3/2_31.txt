Given the declatations in the previous exercise determine whether the
following assignments are legal. Explain how the top-level or low-level const
applies in each case.

r1 = v2; 	legal, we are assigning not binding.
p1 = p2;	illegal, p2 is low level const but p1 isn't
p2 = p1;	legal, you can convert an int pointer to a const int pointer
p1 = p3;	illegal, assigning low level const p3 to p1 that is not low level
p2 = p3;	legal, assigning low level const p3 to low level const p2
