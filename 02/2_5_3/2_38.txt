Describe the differences in type dedution between decltype and auto.
Give an example where they will deduce differing types

Auto will deduce the type of an expression and evaluate it, initializing
the a variable with the value of the evaluated expression

Decltype will analyse an expression to deduce a type for the variable,
it will not initialize it.

An auto delcaration will ignore top level const were as a deltype will not

int a = 777;
int &r = a;
auto i = r;		// i is an int
decltype(i) b = 777;	// b is a int& and therefore must be initalized
