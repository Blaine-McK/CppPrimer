Which of the following initializations are legal? Explain why.

a) int i = -1, &r = 0;		Illegal, cannot bind a reference to a literal
b) int *const p2 = &i2; 	Legal, a pointer of type const is allowed to point to any object, 
				reagardless of whether it is const or not
c) const int i = -1, &r = 0;	Legal, it is possible to assign a reference to const to a literal
d) const int *const p3 = &i2;	Legal, it is possible to assign a const pointer of type const int to an object
				that is either const or non const
e) const int *p1 = &i2;		Legal - p1 may point to an int that is const
f) const int &const r2;		Illegal, syntax error - this is not how a const reference is declared
				Correct that this is illegal but also because a reference must be initialized.
				Compiler output:
				anachronism used: qualifiers on reference are ignored
				error C2530: 'r2': references must be initialized
