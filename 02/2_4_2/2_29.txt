Using the variables in the previous exercise, which of the following assignments are legal? Explain why.

a) i = ic;	legal, assign the value of ic to i
b) p1 = p3;	illegal, p3 is a constant pointer to a constant, p1 is a pointer to a variable. If this was allowed it would change operating range of the constant
c) p1 = &ic;	illegal, p1 must be a const pointer, a variable pointer cannot hold a const
d) p3 = &ic;	illegal, cannot reassign const
e) p2 = p1;	illegal, cannot reassign const
f) ic = *p3;	illegal, cannot reassign const
