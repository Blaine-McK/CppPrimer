Explain the following definitions. For those that are illegal, explain
what is wrong and how to correct it.

a) std::cin >> int input_value;

illegal, you cannont initialise a varaible inside an expression

int input_value;
std::cin >> input_value;

b) int i = { 3.14 }

illegal, a narrowing conversion will be required and list initialisation
does not allow this

c) double salary = wage = 9999.99;

double salary, wage;
salary = wage = 9999.99;

illegal, wage is not of unknown type and is uninitialised

d) int i = 3.14;

legal
