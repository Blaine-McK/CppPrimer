What are the differences between int, long, long long and short? Between
an unsigned and a signed type? Between a float and a double?

An int is 16 bits
A long is 32 bits
A long long is 64 bits
A short is 16 bits

an int is at least as large as a short, a long is at least as large as
an int and a long long is at least as large as a long

A signed type can store numbers above, below and equal to zero. An unsigned
type can only store numbers that are greater than or equal to zero.

A float is a floating point number has a minimum 0f 6 significant digits, though typically 7. It is
typically stored in a word (32 bits)
A double is a floating point number has a minimum 0f 10 significant digits. A double
is normally stored in 2 words (64 bits)
