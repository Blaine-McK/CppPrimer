To calculate a mortgage payment, what types would you use for:

Rate (Percentage interest): unsigned double

Unsigned double as float operations can often take longer than double, unsigned

Principal (Cost of mortgage): double

double as float operations can take longer than double on some machines

Payment (monthly payment cost): double

double as float operations can take longer than double on some machines and even
when not the difference is negligible
